Rick_Roll types the YouTube link into the windows search bar and then pulls up a notepad with text that is lightly informative and fun.

The Cal_Notpad_Cmd_Powershell brings up calculator, CMD in admin and PowerShell in Admin along with the same lightly informative note. This is meant for your slighly more techy friends, or have done a few CTF's, that understand that getting to CLI opens possibilities.



Some issues are timing on different systems. First time running seems to have more issues that a second attempt. You may need to increase delays for some steps.

Codes are only known to work on Windows machines.
